# Ensemble Hindcast

This project aims to store the source code of the SWAN Model and the scripts in Python, used in the Ensemble Hindcast study of waves for southern Brazil.

SWAN wave modelo version 41.31 (http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net/).

Python codes were developed to process SWAN model output data for temporal and spatial analysis of waves.

For the temporal analyses, the "timeseries_analisys_Hs" and "timeseries_analisys_Tp" files follow, which help in the comparative analysis of the ensemble data obtained by SWAN with the buoys of Itajaí and Rio Grande.

To spatially analyze the wave height behavior in 3 extreme events, the "spatial_analisys_ENSMean" script was developed and also attached in this repository.
